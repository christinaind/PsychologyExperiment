# PsychologyExperiment
This is the python file used to program a computerized experiment, which is run by participants on a crowdsourcing platform, specifically the AMT (Amazon Mechanical Turk). The experiment was created on a software called PsychoPy, which possesses a builder and coder interface. Clearly, the file is run on PsychoPy in the coder interface. I programmed the contents of the experiment as well as collected and organized the data. Statistical analysis files are currently with my advisor.

The experiment studies associative learning in humans as well as animals such as pigeons and rats. In the experiment, various displays appear with each including a colored background and a white small shape at the center of the screen. Each time the a click is made in the center, the participant receives a reward. Position, time and location (inside the center shape) of the mouse clicks are recorded. 

An excel file is included to illustrate the recorded data. Only a few rows are recorded as this is a test version of the data. The full excel file is currently with my advisor. 

Note: the column which contains zeros and ones indicates the location of the mouse click. Zero signifies the clock was made outside the shape at the center of the screen while one signifies the clock was made inside it.
